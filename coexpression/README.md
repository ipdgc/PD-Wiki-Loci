#Gene-based measures of tissue-specific gene expression and co-expression using the GTEx7 V6 gene expression dataset (47 tissues including all brain, accessible from https://www.gtexportal.org/home/). For each tissue, the following three columns can be found:

#1) Expression specific: The gene is defined as having tissue-specific expression (=1) if the gene expression in that tissue was 3.5 fold higher than the average expression of all genes in that tissue.

#2) Adjacent specific: The adjacency as a global network measure of connectivity for the gene is specific within the tissue. 1 is defined as the adjacency is 3.5 fold greater than the average expression of all genes in the tissue. 

#3) Module membership: The module membership (local network measure of connectivity) within the co-expression network, is specific within the tissue. 1 is defined as that the module membership is 3.5 fold greater than the average module membership.
